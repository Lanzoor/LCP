# Lanzoor Command Panel 

> Hello! Welcome to the Lanzoor Command Panel info page. Make sure to read all of this file, to download and furthermore run the Lanzoor Command Panel properly.

## What is Lanzoor Command Panel?

Lanzoor Command Panel is a Python program / game that has some useful functions and fun games.

## Installing the Python Interpreter

Sorry for the inconvenience, but Lanzoor Command Panel needs a **Python interpreter** to run. If you already installed the Python interpreter, you can skip this step.

1. Start by downloading the **Python interpreter** by clicking [here](https://python.org/downloads).
2. Download the Python installer based on your OS version.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Set the **Add to PATH** tickbox to on.
5. Click **Install Now**.

If you are done downloading the Python interpreter. You can proceed downloading the Lanzoor Command Panel itself.

## Installing Lanzoor Command Panel

Download the latest version of Lanzoor Command Panel by clicking [here](https://github.com/Lanzoor/LCP/releases/latest). Make sure to download the ZIP file. Now, unzip the ZIP file that you downloaded.

The ZIP file will include:
- **`README.md`**: Information that may be needed
- **`script.py`**: The main program
- **`savedata.json`**: Savefile for all of your progress.
- **`transfer_guide.md`**: A detailed guide on how to transfer your savedata into other versions.

> NOTE: If you already have a savefile, you can just copy-paste your previous `savefile.json` file here. You should also check out the `transfer_guide.md` file if needed.

## Running Lanzoor Command Panel

Before you run Lanzoor Command Panel, you need to install this external library.

```bash
pip install colorama
```

If that doesn't work, it's either these cases;

### 1. For some reason, pip can't be recognized as a command. In this case, you should use this command.

```bash
py -m pip install blahblahblah
```

Note that you should change this script correspondingly to the python command that you usually refer to. If `py` doesn't work, try `python`, `python3`, or `python3.13`.

### 2. Your pip is outdated. In this case, the install command will work without any problem, but to prevent any furthermore issues, run this command.

```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Note that you should change this script correspondingly to the python command that you usually refer to. If `py` doesn't work, try `python`, `python3`, or `python3.13`.

### 3. Your Python is not on PATH.

In the search bar (next to your Start menu / windows icon), type "Edit environment variables in your account", and click it.
After that, click "Path" and click "Edit".
If you don't see the Python interpreter in an `exe` format here, you should uninstall your Python interpreter and retrace your steps back to **Installing the Python Interpreter**.

### 4. Your Python is set to a venv.

This project does not require a venv to run, thus making it safe to switch to a global installation!


If you are done installing those files or the ZIP file, double click on the **`script.py`** file. It will show you a pop up, saying to choose which app/program to open this file with; click the option **Python**.

It will now open up the terminal, which is the Lanzoor Command Panel itself. Now have fun!

> NOTE: If you want to enjoy the true game, I definitely recommend playing the game without taking a peek at the game files / modifying the savefile.

> ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are updating your Lanzoor Command Panel, make sure to also download a fresh new savedata file.
> You can just proceed fine if both versions are same.
> Why? Well, this is because a new update might add an option; must also update the savedata file format according to the script.
> At least it is better than getting a lot of errors because of an undefined key.

> LAST NOTE: When you start LCP, it will go through a process called inspection; it will tell you if your savedata file is outdated or you don't have packages installed.
