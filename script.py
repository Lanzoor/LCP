And, here are some few things that you should probably consider using Lanzoor Command Panel.
This program is NOT case sensitive. This means that for using commands, it will still properly work if you input something like ?HeLP.
This program is entirely built in Python (with the help of a json file but that's only a json file not an actual program).
If you want to enjoy the true game, I definitely recommend playing the game without taking a peek at the game files / modifying the savefile.
